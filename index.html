            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>I enjoy exploring creative worlds through anime, gaming, and sports. Anime is something I can watch anytime, and I like playing video games with friends.
            Right now, most of my gaming time goes into <b>Star Citizen</b>. My favorite meal is steak with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. If I could travel anywhere, I would visit
            Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, as well as Anchorage, Alaska. My firends decribe me as a helpul freind they can turn to. I am also very exited to continue building my skills in
            software development to lay a foundation for my future.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Show to Watch on CrunchyRoll</h2>
            <img src="img/OnePiece.jpg" alt="My Favorite Show!">
            <p>This is a picture of the anime called One Piece! This anime put it's author, Eiichiro Oda, as the 7th highest selling author in history. His sales has have placed him among
            legendary authors like William Shaspeare.</p>
            <p>This show has been a great watch for me. It gradually became my favorite over the 1100 episodes I watched. I even started to read the manga! This anime is full of hardships, joy, comedy, 
            backstorys, character development, world building, and so much more! </p>
